I’m a professional musician, composer, creative technologist and product designer based in Los Angeles, California. She received her MFA in Performance & Composition with a focus on Music Technology at the California Institute of the Arts and a BA in Ethnomusicology (Jazz Trumpet) and a Music Industry minor from UCLA. 

My recent work focuses on the intersection between identity, improvisation, and live performance interaction between the performer's body and their instrument through gesture and sound. I am especially passionate about co-designing musical interfaces with and for historically underrepresented communities and artists so that they can freely express themselves. 

My latest work is Nami, a custom built glove interface designed for live musical performance utilizing gesture recognition tools and community research. I’m also a member of the Pan Afrikan People's Arkestra, an artist-in-residence with Poieto (also known as the “The Cultural AI Design Tool”), and a Japanese American Cultural & Community Center (JACCC) and Sustainable Little Tokyo (SLT) Nikkei Music Reclamation Project Fellow. She is also a recipient of the 2019 ASCAP Foundation Johnny Mandel Prize and Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composer Award, and the 2018 BMI Future Jazz Master Scholarship. 

I have a background in music cataloguing and metadata within the B2B industry, for film & tv, and at record labels. Currently, I am the Music Programming Manager at Cloud Cover Music.

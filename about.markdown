I’m a professional musician, composer, creative technologist and product designer based in Los Angeles, California. I'm an avid learner and am curious about what makes us human and how we navigate and interact with the world. My focus has been the intersection between identity, improvisation, and live performance interaction between the performer's body and their instrument or environment through gesture and sound. I am especially passionate about co-designing musical interfaces with and for historically underrepresented communities and artists so that they can freely express themselves.

My latest work is Nami, a custom built glove interface designed for live musical performance utilizing gesture recognition tools and community research. I have published papers in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) which can be seen [here](/media).

 I’m also a member of the Pan Afrikan People's Arkestra, an artist-in-residence with Poieto (also known as the “The Cultural AI Design Tool”), and a Japanese American Cultural & Community Center (JACCC) and Sustainable Little Tokyo (SLT) Nikkei Music Reclamation Project Fellow. I'm also a recipient of the 2019 ASCAP Foundation Johnny Mandel Prize and Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composer Award, and the 2018 BMI Future Jazz Master Scholarship. I received my MFA in Performance & Composition with a focus on Music Technology at the California Institute of the Arts and a BA in Ethnomusicology (Jazz Trumpet) and a Music Industry minor from UCLA. 

I have a strong background in research, data analysis, music curation, cataloguing and metadata within the B2B (think music experiences in retail, restaurant, etc.!), film & tv, and at record labels. Currently, I am the Music Programming Manager at Cloud Cover Music.

title: Sound UX

Currently, I'm the Music Programming Manager at Cloud Cover Music. I've worked at this leading B2B background music SaaS solution provider for the past 6 years and some of the most interesting work has been developing the signature sound experiences and playlists for a number of the most well-known North American brands. I can't share any specifics, however, if you've been at a local restaurant, mall, grocery store, or gym, you've likely heard some of my work here and there! 


During my time at Cloud Cover Music, I developed the proprietary _Cloud Cover Music Brand Sound Process_. This process allows all of our important stakeholders to have insight and a say into the development of their personalized sound experience. 

These are some of the key questions I asked myself as the lead curator and researcher: 

1. Who is the key stakeholder? 
2. How will this sound experience support the brand?
3. What are the main business goals we are addressing?
4. Where and when will this sound experience take place?
5. If we do not have the answers to the above, what research needs to be completed?

 Through our in-depth and nuanced brand sound analysis, we've secured clients with hundreds of locations across the country, and we continually are refining the process to create the best sound experience for our customers.

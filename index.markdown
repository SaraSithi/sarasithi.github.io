# Nami

Nami is a custom built glove interface designed for cross-cultural musical exploration and performance.

Nami is outfitted on the performer’s (user’s) left hand leaving the right hand available for playing an instrument (trumpet). In real-time the performer can manage multiple controls exploring, expanding, and amplifying the trumpet sound in the left hand. 

The Japanese word “nami” means “wave.” In the musical and social context it can be interpreted as an embodiment of life experiences expressed in each musical beat that is free flowing and unrestricted by bar lines. As a designer, I want Nami to be flexible and adaptable, and for various iterations of Nami to exist that embrace a variety of cultural bodies (embodied experiences) and their respective cross-cultural gestural vocabularies.

My role:
- Lead designer
- Builder
- Creator
- Performer

### Challenge

- As a trumpet player, using guitar pedals and trumpet mutes (physical filters) are often awkward to use during a live performance and can detract from the music-making experience and only provide limited control over effects
- Many commercially available musical interfaces, DAWs, and musical notation software are culture specific in which the purpose, intent, and material reflect and privilege a particular cultural framework (i.e. Sibelius privileges the Western notation system) limiting artists outside of these culture specific frameworks from being able to freely express themselves
- Custom interfaces, musical gear and technology can often be cost prohibitive 

### Key Goal

- I wanted to develop a new interface for trumpet that explores identity and privileges improvisation and live performance interaction between the performer’s (user’s) body and their instrument (trumpet) through gesture and sound

### Background
- Poieto (otherwise known as the “Cultural AI Design Tool”) is an exploratory (non-prescriptive) research and design tool (and framework) centered on socio-cultural context to inform the design of artificial intelligence and machine learning interfaces developed by Christine Meinders. It is based on the Feminist.AI Design Philosophy which focuses on designing collaboratively with and for unheard voices and communities considering their respective “sensory, cultural and emotional conditions” and the inclusion of “embodiment in AI design” and lived experiences. I used Poieto as the framework for iterating and building Nami. For more details about the Cultural AI Design Tool and the design of Nami, please refer to my paper, ["Exploring Identity Through Design: A Focus on the Cultural Body Via Nami"](https://www.nime.org/proceedings/2020/nime2020_paper109.pdf) published in the proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), 21-25 July 2020.
- The Poieto framework consists of the following 5 phases which will be described in more detail below: 
    - Sketching: Blueprint Part 1
    - Concept: Blueprint Part 2
    - Critical Thinking: Cultural Lenses
    - Reflections: Scaffolding
    - Implementation

*iterating multiple times is highly encouraged

### Sketching: Blueprint Part 1: Input + Rules + Materials
During the Sketching Phase, my main focus was on the purpose of the musical interface. So why am I doing this? 

### Input (or User Profile):
- At first, Nami was created for myself as a trumpet player and as an interface in which I could control processing my acoustic trumpet sound in-real time. The gestures I used would not only  (include image)

My cultural perspective is varied between and not limited to the following identity descriptors: 
- Performer
- Trumpet player
- Composer
- Improviser
- Nikkei (Japanese American)

### Rules
Existing augmented trumpet interfaces have largely depended upon traditional effective gestures including valve pressing in the right hand, extending the first or third valves slides or utilizing various mutes and their accompanying gestures with the left hand. Nami is unique in that it privileges the exploration of accompanist and figurative gesture while allowing the performer access to multiple simultaneous controls. 

### Output (Form)
This is a glove interface that uses sensor technology to capture gestural data such as finger flexing and finger pressure.

### Concept: Blueprint Part 2: Interaction Design
During the Concept phase, 

### Product Design Considerations: 
- No permanent or damaging modification is required to host trumpet/instrument
- The technology allows the performer to move freely
- The technology does not allow excessive strain or tension within performer’s body
- The technology encourages the performer to explore their identity and presence in the live performance context through gestural content/movement, customized form and material of the glove itself
- The technology does not impede instrument playability or inhibit use of unconventional and extended techniques
- The technology encourages a hands-off approach to the laptop so that performance can be done solely through glove interface and instruments

### Types of Mappings
Embodied Design Improvisation (exploration of gestures based on different types of sensors)

### Critical Thinking: Cultural Lenses

### User profile
- As I continued to iterate, I began to develop versions of Nami through specific community lenses: Little Tokyo artist community in Downtown Los Angeles through Festival of Shadows (include image) as well as the local Los Angeles maker community for the SupplyFrame Design Lab and CalArts AI.Culture.Creativity event and week
- Butoh and somatic movement
